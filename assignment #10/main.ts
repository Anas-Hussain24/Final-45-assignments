//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them

//names
let names: string[] = ["Ali", "Bilal", "Ahmed", "Hanif", "Shayan" ,"Mazz"];

// Print each person's name
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Hello "${names[i]}" ,I hope your day is filled with joy and laughter!`);
}
